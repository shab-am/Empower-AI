## **The Problem We're Solving**

India has a low participation rate in stock market investments, with only 3% of the population involved, far behind countries like the USA and China.  
This is due to:

- Perceived complexity of stock markets.
- Limited awareness of investment options.
- Apprehension towards market volatility.

At the same time, India's renewable energy sector is in dire need of more investment to meet environmental and energy demands, but faces challenges such as:

- Regulatory uncertainties.
- Financial constraints.
